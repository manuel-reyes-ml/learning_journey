    "- itertools.islice() is a memory-efficient tool 🛠️ that allows you to extract a specific range of items from any iterable 🔄, such as a generator, a list, or a huge data file. I'll help guide you through how it works with some questions along the way.\n",
    "- Unlike standard list slicing (my_list[0:10]), islice is \"lazy.\" It doesn't load all the data into your computer's memory 🧠 at once. Instead, it discards items one by one until it reaches your start point, yields the items you want, and then stops\n",

    "\n",
    "| Format | Arguments | What it does |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Short** | `islice(iterable, stop)` | Starts at the beginning and goes until it reaches the `stop` index. |\n",
    "| **Full** | `islice(iterable, start, stop, step)` | Gives you a specific range and can skip items using `step`. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Parameters ⚙️\n",
    "\n",
    "* **iterable** 🧬: This is your source of data—it could be a list, a string, or even a generator that pulls data from a file.\n",
    "* **start** 🏁: The index where you want to begin (defaults to 0 in the short version).\n",
    "* **stop** 🛑: The index where you want to end. **Note:** Just like standard Python slicing, the item at this index is **not** included.\n",
    "* **step** 🏃: How many items to move forward each time. A step of 2 would give you every other item.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** One unique thing about `islice` is that you can use `None` for the `start` or `step` arguments if you want them to use their default values while still providing a `stop` or `step`."
