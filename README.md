**This repository demonstrates:**
- ✅ **Production system deployed** - Live ETL pipeline saving $15K/year with public code
- ✅ **AI integration from Day 1** - ChatGPT, Cursor AI, PandasAI in active use
- ✅ **Enterprise analytics in development** - Operations-Demand-Intelligence with AI chat interface
- ✅ **Domain expertise** - 15+ years data experience, 8 years finance, 6 years trading
- ✅ **Measurable business impact** - 95% efficiency gains, documented results
- ✅ **Systematic AI-powered progression** - Clear 37-month path with AI at every stage

**The key differentiator:** Already delivering production value while building toward LLM engineering, with transparent AI integration throughout.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Differentiation (2026 Market Advantage)

In 2025, AI literacy is essential for data professionals. While most candidates learn traditional tools only, this journey integrates AI systematically from the start.

### **The AI-Enhancement Framework**

Each stage combines traditional data skills with AI augmentation:

**Stage 1: AI-Powered Data Analyst** 🟢 ACTIVE
```
Foundation: Python, SQL, Statistics, Visualization
+ AI Layer: ChatGPT workflows, Cursor AI IDE, PandasAI, Prompt Engineering
= Result: AI-powered dashboards with natural language interfaces
```

**Stage 2: AI-Powered Data Engineer** 📅 PLANNED  
```
Foundation: AWS, Airflow, PySpark, PostgreSQL
+ AI Layer: dbt, LangChain basics, intelligent monitoring
= Result: AI-enhanced pipelines with smart automation
```

**Stages 3-5** progress through ML Engineering → LLM Specialist → Senior LLM Engineer, with AI capabilities expanding at each level.

### **Why This Matters**

| Traditional Path | AI-Powered Path (This Journey) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Learn tools → Get job → Maybe add AI later | Learn tools + AI together → Land AI-ready role |
| Positioned with majority of candidates | Positioned ahead of 95% of candidates |
| Standard market rates | 15-20% salary premium for AI skills |
| Limited future trajectory | Clear path to LLM engineering |

**Market reality:** The AI agent market is growing 823% in 2025. Companies need professionals who bridge data workflows and AI implementation—not one or the other.

## 🏆 Production & Portfolio Highlights

### **[1099 Reconciliation ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/1099_reconciliation_pipeline)** ✅ Live Production

Automated Python ETL pipeline for retirement plan distribution reconciliation at Daybright Financial.

**Impact:** 95% time reduction (4-6 hours → 15 min/week) | $15,000+ annual savings | 10x scalability | Zero errors

**Tech:** Python • pandas • openpyxl • matplotlib • pytest • GitHub Actions CI

---

### **[Operations-Demand-Intelligence](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/operations-demand-intelligence)** 🚧 Second Project to Launch

**AI-Powered Workflow Demand Analysis** for data-driven staffing decisions using OnBase enterprise data.

Analyzing 8+ months of workflow data to enable intelligent resource allocation with AI-powered natural language insights.

**Business Challenge:**  
Operations teams lack visibility into workflow demand patterns, leading to reactive staffing and resource inefficiencies. No data-driven approach for Distribution vs Loan workflow segmentation.

**AI-Powered Solution:**

| Feature | Implementation | AI Enhancement |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Demand Analysis** | Volume patterns, Distribution vs Loan segmentation | AI-powered trend detection, anomaly alerts |
| **Interactive Dashboard** | Streamlit with Plotly visualizations | **PandasAI chat:** "Why did loan volume spike in March?" |
| **Insights Generation** | Traditional business metrics | **AI-generated commentary** for stakeholders |
| **Data Privacy** | PII handling, synthetic data for GitHub | AI with privacy guardrails, read-only access |

**What Makes It Stand Out:**
- ✅ **Enterprise system integration** - Real OnBase workflow data (8+ months)
- ✅ **AI chat interface** - Natural language queries with SQL transparency
- ✅ **Business impact focus** - Data-driven staffing recommendations
- ✅ **Production-grade privacy** - Proper PII handling with synthetic data for GitHub

**Tech:** Python • pandas • Streamlit • **PandasAI** • Plotly • GitHub Actions CI • data anonymization

**Status:** Active development - launching as Stage 1 second major project

---

### **[Attention-Flow Catalyst](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/attention-flow-catalyst)** 📅 Next Project to Complete

> **Research Question:** Which trigger or combination best predicts +10% price moves within 3 trading days?

**Flagship project evolving through all 5 career stages:**

| Stage | Focus | AI Integration |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **1 (Next)** | Statistical backtesting, signal leaderboard | AI chat interface (PandasAI), AI insights |
| **2** | AWS pipelines, 500+ tickers | AI monitoring, intelligent alerts |
| **3** | ML predictions, ensemble models | AutoML, AI feature engineering |
| **4** | ❌ Traditional N/A | ✅ **Natural language trading interface (RAG)** |
| **5** | Production deployment | ✅ **Multi-agent AI orchestration** |

**Phase 1A (To Complete):** Dynamic stock screener • Alternative data collection (SEC, Wikipedia, News) • Statistical backtesting with bootstrap confidence • Trigger leaderboard

**Phase 1B (Then Build):** Streamlit dashboard + **PandasAI chat interface** + **AI-generated commentary** + Natural language queries

**What makes it defensible:** Walk-forward validation • Survivorship bias controls • Modern stack (DuckDB, Parquet) • Progressive architecture through all career stages
