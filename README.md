## 💪 What Makes This Different

### **Most Learning Repositories:**
```
✓ Tutorial completions
✓ Course exercises  
✓ Personal projects
✗ No production experience
✗ No domain expertise
✗ No measurable business impact
```

### **This Repository:**
```
✓ Tutorial completions (enhanced beyond requirements)
✓ Course exercises (optimized and expanded)
✓ Personal projects (production-grade quality)
✓ Production ETL system (live, saving $15K/year)
✓ Finance domain expertise (10+ years data, 8 years finance, 6 years trading)
✓ Measurable business impact (95% efficiency gain, public code)
✓ Systematic 37-month roadmap (structured progression)
✓ Building in public (transparent, accountable)
```

**Key Differentiator:** Not just learning—already delivering production value with public, reviewable code.

## 🏆 Production & Portfolio Highlights

### **1099 Reconciliation ETL Pipeline** ✅ Live Production
**Repository:** [1099_reconciliation_pipeline](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/1099_reconciliation_pipeline) 🌐 Public

**Business Challenge:**  
Manual reconciliation of retirement plan distributions took 4-6 hours weekly, was error-prone, and blocked critical 1099-R tax reporting.

**Technical Solution:**  
Automated Python ETL pipeline using pandas and openpyxl that extracts, transforms, validates, and reconciles data between two financial systems (Relius and Matrix).

**Measurable Impact:**
- ⚡ **95% time reduction** (4-6 hours → 15 minutes weekly)
- 💰 **$15,000+ annual savings** in labor costs
- 📊 **10x scalability** (300+ accounts vs. 30 manual capacity)
- ✅ **Zero errors** since deployment through automated validation

**Why It Matters:** Real enterprise system integration with measurable ROI—not a tutorial project.

### **Attention-Flow Catalyst** 🚧 Flagship Project (Phase 1A Active)
**Repository:** [attention-flow-catalyst](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/attention-flow-catalyst) 🌐 Public

> **Research Question:** Which trigger or combination best predicts +10% price moves within 3 trading days?

**One project, five stages, complete career demonstration.**

This is my **flagship project** evolving through all 5 stages of my career transition—from Data Analyst to Senior LLM Engineer:

**What It Does:**
```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Stock Screener │ ──► │  Data Pipeline  │ ──► │ Trigger Detection│
│  50 small-caps  │     │  3yr history    │     │  T1-T4 signals   │
│  (<$5, listed)  │     │  per ticker     │     │  + combinations  │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Signal Generator│ ◄── │   Leaderboard   │ ◄── │ Backtest Engine │
│  daily watchlist│     │  rank by hit    │     │  test all combos│
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

**Stock Screening Criteria:**
- Price < $5 (bigger % move potential)
- Listed exchanges only (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX — NO OTC)
- Small float (limited shares = faster moves)
- Strong sector (auto-detected by relative strength)

**Triggers Being Tested:**

| ID | Trigger | Data Source | What It Detects |
|----|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **T1** | SEC Form 4 Insider Buy | edgartools | Smart money activity |
| **T2** | Wikipedia Attention Spike | Wikipedia API | Public attention surge |
| **T3** | News Mention Spike | RSS/GDELT | Media coverage |
| **T4** | Volume Accumulation | yfinance | Institutional buying (RVOL, OBV, quiet accumulation) |

**Combination Testing:** All individual triggers, 2-trigger, 3-trigger, and 4-trigger combinations with sector & index context filters.

**Project Evolution Through 5 Career Stages:**

| Stage | Version | Focus | Key Deliverable |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **1 (DA)** | v2.0 | Backtest engine | Trigger leaderboard, signal generator |
| **2 (DE)** | v4.0 | Cloud scale | 500+ tickers, Airflow automation |
| **3 (ML)** | v5.0 | Predictions | ML ensemble, auto-optimization |
| **4 (LLM)** | v6.0 | AI Assistant | Natural language interface, RAG |
| **5 (Sr)** | v7.0 | Production | Monetization platform ($2-50K/mo) |

**Why This Project Stands Out:**
- ✅ **Dynamic screening** — Program finds stocks automatically (not manual list)
- ✅ **Real SEC data** — Form 4 insider transactions via edgartools
- ✅ **Statistical rigor** — Proper backtesting with combination testing
- ✅ **Volume analysis** — RVOL, OBV, accumulation patterns (institutional footprint)
- ✅ **Domain expertise** — 6 years trading knowledge codified into algorithms
- ✅ **Progressive architecture** — Evolves through all 5 career stages

**Tech Stack:** Python • SQLite • pandas • edgartools • yfinance • Wikipedia API • matplotlib

## 👨‍💻 Enhancement Philosophy

### **Beyond Basic Completion:**

Every exercise is enhanced with additional functionality, error handling, testing, and real-world application.

**Standard Approach:**
```python
# Calculate average
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

**My Enhanced Approach:**
```python
def calculate_statistics(data, include_outliers=True):
    """
    Calculate comprehensive statistics with multiple methods.
    
    Args:
        data: List of numeric values
        include_outliers: Whether to include outlier analysis
    
    Returns:
        dict: Statistics including mean, median, mode, std dev
    """
    import statistics
    from collections import Counter
    
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate statistics on empty dataset")
    
    stats = {
        'mean': statistics.mean(data),
        'median': statistics.median(data),
        'mode': statistics.mode(data) if len(Counter(data)) < len(data) else None,
        'std_dev': statistics.stdev(data) if len(data) > 1 else 0,
        'range': (min(data), max(data))
    }
    
    if include_outliers:
        q1 = statistics.quantiles(data, n=4)[0]
        q3 = statistics.quantiles(data, n=4)[2]
        iqr = q3 - q1
        stats['outliers'] = [x for x in data if x < (q1 - 1.5*iqr) or x > (q3 + 1.5*iqr)]
    
    return stats

# Apply to real trading data
stock_returns = [0.05, 0.03, -0.02, 0.04, 0.01, 0.15]  # 15% is potential outlier
analysis = calculate_statistics(stock_returns)
print(f"Return Analysis: {analysis}")
```

**Commit Convention:**
```
Enhance: implement comprehensive statistics calculator
- Added mean, median, mode, std dev calculations
- Outlier detection using IQR method  
- Applied to stock return analysis
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for edge cases
```

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

### **Why Building in Public:**

**Transparency:** Real learning is messy - showing the actual process, not just polished results

**Accountability:** Public commits create public commitment - progress is visible and verifiable

**Community:** Others learn from my journey; I learn from feedback and collaboration

**Portfolio:** This repository itself demonstrates coding ability, consistency, and work ethic

**Future Platform:** Foundation for blog posts, tutorials, courses, and thought leadership (Stage 5)

### **Core Principles:**

1. **Practice > Theory** - Daily coding practice, minimum 20 minutes
2. **Enhancement Always** - Never just "complete" exercises, always improve them
3. **Document Thinking** - Commit messages explain reasoning, not just changes
4. **Real-World Focus** - Apply every skill to trading/finance domain
5. **Quality > Quantity** - Deep understanding beats surface-level completion
6. **Sustainable Pace** - Marathon approach: 25 hrs/week for 37 months
7. **Production Mindset** - Write code as if it's going to production (it might!)
