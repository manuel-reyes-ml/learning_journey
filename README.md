# Data, AI & Trading Learning Journey 🚀

Week-by-week practice projects and exercises for my roadmap:
**Bookkeeping & Trading → Data Analyst → Data Engineer → ML Engineer → LLM Engineer**  

I’m building a unique mix of **data analytics, machine learning, LLM engineering, and trading** skills, and documenting everything here.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- Transitioning from **retirement bookkeeping** to **Data & AI** roles  
- Background in **finance and trading** (swing/day trading, market structure)  
- Long-term goal: work remotely as a **Data/ML/LLM Engineer** with a focus on **trading & quantitative systems**  
- This repo is my public notebook: small scripts, experiments, and projects as I level up

## 🧭 Roadmap (High Level)

1. **Data Analyst** – Python, SQL, Excel, statistics, dashboards, real-world datasets  
2. **Data Engineer** – ETL, data pipelines, databases, cloud tooling  
3. **ML Engineer** – advanced ML, model training, evaluation, deployment  
4. **LLM Engineer** – prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, LLM-powered apps  
5. **Trading Integration (parallel)** – continuously apply skills to **trading algorithms & analytics**

I’m working on **trading algorithmic ideas** throughout the journey (data pipelines, signals, backtests).
