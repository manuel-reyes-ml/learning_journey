## IBM Data Analyst

- Based on the goals and outcomes that need to be achieved, there are four primary types of Data Analysis: 
  * Descriptive Analytics, that helps decode “What happened.” 
  * Diagnostic Analytics, that helps us understand “Why it happened.” 
  * Predictive Analytics, that analyzes historical data and trends to suggest “What will happen next.” 
  * Prescriptive Analytics, that prescribes “What should be done next.” 
  
- The Data Analysis process involves:
  * Developing an understanding of the problem and the desired outcome. 
  * Setting a clear metric for evaluating outcomes. 
  * Gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and mining data to interpret results. 
  * Communicating the findings in ways that impact decision-making. 

- Required skills for daya analysis
  * Technical skils: Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Excel, Google Sheet and Power BI
  * Soft skills: Curiosity, Always willing to learn, Decisions regarding the right data and right tools, Presenting data to key stakeholders, Business acumen, Presentation skills

- The role of a Data Analyst spans across:

  * Acquiring data that best serves the use case.

  * Preparing and analyzing data to understand what it represents.

  * Interpreting and effectively communicating the message to stakeholders who need to act on the findings.

  * Ensuring that the process is documented for future reference and repeatability.  

- In order to play this role successfully, Data Analysts need a mix of technical, functional, and soft skills.  

  * Technical Skills include varying levels of proficiency in using spreadsheets, statistical tools, visualization tools, programming and querying languages, and the ability to work with different types of data repositories and big data platforms.

  * An understanding of Statistics, Analytical techniques, problem-solving, the ability to probe a situation from multiple perspectives, data visualization, and project management skills – all of which come under Functional Skills a Data Analyst needs in order to play an effective role.

  * Soft Skills include the ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, tell a compelling story with data, and garner support and buy-in from stakeholders. Curiosity to explore different pathways and intuition that helps to give a sense of the future based on past experiences are also essential skills for being a good Data Analyst.  

- Applications of generative AI in data analytics
  * Generative AI has many applications that can enhance your data analytics work:

  * Data augmentation: Create synthetic data to augment existing data sets, which is especially useful when data is scarce or imbalanced. This can improve predictive model performance.

  * Anomaly Detection: Identify anomalies or outliers by understanding the distribution of normal data. This is valuable in fraud detection, network security, and quality control.

  * Text and image generation: Generate realistic text and images for marketing, content creation, and customer engagement, such as automatic product descriptions and marketing visuals.

  * Simulation and forecasting: Simulate scenarios and forecast future events by generating potential outcomes from historical data. This is crucial in financial planning, supply chain management, and strategic decision-making.

### Generative AI for Data Analysts

As a beginner in data analytics, you’re stepping into a field that’s rapidly evolving. Generative AI is becoming an essential tool for data analysts, allowing them to create new content and gain deeper insights. Let’s explore what generative AI is and how it can enhance your skills.

#### What is generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that create new content such as text, images, music, and more by learning patterns from existing data. 

Generative AI can respond naturally to human conversation and serve as a tool for customer service and personalization of customer workflows. For example, you can use AI-powered chatbots, voice bots, and virtual assistants that respond more accurately to customers for first-contact resolution.

#### How does generative AI work?

Generative AI starts with a prompt that could be in the form of a text, an image, a video, a design, musical notes, or any input that the AI system can process. Various AI algorithms then return new content in response to the prompt. Content can include essays, solutions to problems, or realistic fakes created from pictures or audio of a person.

Early versions of generative AI required submitting data via an API or an otherwise complicated process. Developers had to familiarize themselves with special tools and write applications using languages such as Python.

Now, pioneers in generative AI are developing better user experiences that let you describe a request in plain language. After an initial response, you can also customize the results with feedback about the style, tone, and other elements you want the generated content to reflect.

#### Key techniques in generative AI:

Generative adversarial networks (GANs): GANs consist of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator creates new data, whereas the discriminator evaluates it. Over time, the generator improves to produce realistic data.

Variational autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs encode input data into a compressed format and then decode it back, generating new data points similar to the input data.

Transformers: Used primarily in natural language processing (NLP), transformers generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence. Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a notable example.
