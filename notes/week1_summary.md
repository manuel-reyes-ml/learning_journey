## IBM Data Analyst

- Based on the goals and outcomes that need to be achieved, there are four primary types of Data Analysis: 
  * Descriptive Analytics, that helps decode “What happened.” 
  * Diagnostic Analytics, that helps us understand “Why it happened.” 
  * Predictive Analytics, that analyzes historical data and trends to suggest “What will happen next.” 
  * Prescriptive Analytics, that prescribes “What should be done next.” 
  
- The Data Analysis process involves:
  * Developing an understanding of the problem and the desired outcome. 
  * Setting a clear metric for evaluating outcomes. 
  * Gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and mining data to interpret results. 
  * Communicating the findings in ways that impact decision-making.
