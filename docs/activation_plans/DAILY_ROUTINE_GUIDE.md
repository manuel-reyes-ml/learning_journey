#### **5:00-5:45 AM - Hands-On Practice (45 min)**

**What to Do:**
1. **Open practice platform** (DataCamp/HackerRank)
2. **Apply what you just learned**
3. **Type ALL code yourself** (no copy-paste!)
4. **Experiment:** Change values, break things, fix them
5. **Document:** Save solutions with comments

```

**Example Code Documentation:**
```python
# financial_calculator.py
# Created: 2026-01-08
# Purpose: Calculate simple interest for bookkeeping clients
# Learning: Variables, arithmetic operators, f-strings

def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate simple interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): Initial amount
        rate (float): Annual interest rate (as decimal)
        time (int): Time period in years

    Returns:
        float: Interest amount

    Example:
        >>> calculate_simple_interest(1000, 0.05, 2)
        100.0
    """
    interest = principal * rate * time
    return interest

# Test cases
print(f"Interest on $1000 at 5% for 2 years: ${calculate_simple_interest(1000, 0.05, 2)}")
print(f"Interest on $5000 at 3.5% for 5 years: ${calculate_simple_interest(5000, 0.035, 5)}")
```

3. **Code incrementally** (test as you go)
4. **Submit when working**
5. **Review top solutions** (learn different approaches)
6. **Document your solution** in your repo:

```python
# hackerrank_solutions/day_01_hello_world.py
"""
Problem: Say "Hello, World!" With Python
Difficulty: Easy
Date Solved: 2026-01-09

My Approach:
- Used print() function with string literal
- Learned: Python uses "" or '' for strings

What I learned from other solutions:
- Some people used f-strings even for simple prints
- Triple quotes allow multi-line strings
"""

print("Hello, World!")
```

## 🎯 SATURDAY DEEP WORK BLOCK (5:00 AM - 8:30 AM + 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
**Duration:** 5.5 hours total | **Energy:** HIGHEST | **Best For:** Projects, deep learning, experiments

---

### Morning Deep Work (5:00 AM - 8:30 AM) - 3.5 hours

#### **5:00-6:30 AM - Book Study / Comprehensive Learning (90 min)**

**Purpose:** Deep, focused reading and note-taking

**Strategy:**
1. **Choose ONE book/long-form content**
2. **Pomodoro technique:**
   - 25 min reading + 5 min note-taking
   - 25 min reading + 5 min note-taking
   - 25 min coding examples + 5 min testing
3. **Implement examples** from the book in your own code

**Example Saturday Session:**
```
5:00-5:25  → Read "Data Smart" Chapter 1 (Excel concepts)
5:25-5:30  → Write chapter summary notes
5:30-5:55  → Read how to translate Excel to Python
5:55-6:00  → Code simple Excel equivalent in Python
6:00-6:25  → Try chapter's example with your data
6:25-6:30  → Commit code to GitHub
```

---

#### **6:30-7:30 AM - DataCamp Intensive (60 min)**

**Goal:** Complete 1-2 full chapters

**Approach:**
```
6:30-6:50  → Chapter exercises (aggressive practice)
6:50-7:10  → Repeat difficult exercises
7:10-7:25  → Experiment with concepts in Jupyter
7:25-7:30  → Document patterns you discovered
```

**Experimentation Example:**
```python
# jupyter_experiments/saturday_week1_lists.ipynb

# Official DataCamp Exercise:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(numbers))

# My Experiments:
# What if I use strings instead?
words = ["data", "analyst", "journey"]
# print(sum(words))  # This breaks! Why?

# Can I sum lengths instead?
word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words]
print(sum(word_lengths))  # Works!

# What else can I discover about lists?
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0, True]
print(type(mixed[0]))  # int
print(type(mixed[1]))  # str
# Python lists can hold different types!
```
