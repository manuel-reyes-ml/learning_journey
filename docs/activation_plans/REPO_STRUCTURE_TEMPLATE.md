## 🎨 STYLING & BEST PRACTICES

### Emoji Usage Guidelines

```
Use sparingly and strategically:

✅ Section headers (clear organization)
✅ Status indicators (✅ done, ❌ not done, 🟡 in progress)
✅ Call-outs and highlights

❌ Don't overuse (looks unprofessional)
❌ Don't use for every bullet point
❌ Don't use multiple per line

Good:
📊 Week 1 Statistics

Bad:
📊🎉💪 Week 1 Statistics 🚀✨🔥
```

---

### Markdown Formatting Tips

```markdown
# H1 - Use for main title only
## H2 - Major sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Rarely needed

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italic* for slight emphasis
`code` for inline code/commands

> Blockquotes for important notes

- Bullet lists for items
1. Numbered lists for sequences

[Links](url) for external resources

![Images](image-url) for screenshots

```python
# Code blocks with language specified
for better syntax highlighting
```

Horizontal rules for visual breaks
---

Tables for structured data:
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data     | More data|
```

---

### Professional Writing Standards

**Do:**
```
✅ Write complete sentences
✅ Use proper grammar and spelling
✅ Be specific with numbers and dates
✅ Tell a story (beginning, middle, end)
✅ Show personality while staying professional
✅ Update regularly
✅ Proofread before committing
```

**Don't:**
```
❌ Use text speak (u, ur, etc.)
❌ All caps UNLESS NECESSARY
❌ Excessive punctuation!!!
❌ Vague statements ("did some coding")
❌ Negativity about learning process
❌ Leave content stale/outdated
```

---

## 🔄 MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

### Daily:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day X: [Brief summary of what you did]"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ STRUCTURE VERIFICATION

**Before calling your repo "done" each week:**

```
□ All files have purpose (no random test files)
□ README is up-to-date with accurate info
□ Every folder has its own README
□ .gitignore is preventing sensitive data
□ Links work (test them!)
□ No typos in public-facing text
□ Commit messages are meaningful
□ File naming is consistent
□ Can navigate to any file in < 3 clicks
```

**Test:** Show repo to someone non-technical
- Can they understand what you're doing?
- Can they find your best work?
- Would they think you're organized?

If YES to all → Structure is solid!

---

**Remember:** Your GitHub repo is your living portfolio. Keep it organized, updated, and professional!

**Next Steps:** Start implementing this structure in your `data-analyst-journey` repository!
