## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Perfectionism paralysis** - Code doesn't need to be perfect, just working
2. **Tutorial hopping** - Stick to your roadmap, resist shiny objects
3. **Skipping documentation** - Write that README, even if basic
4. **Isolation** - Post on LinkedIn, engage with community
5. **Burning out** - Respect your schedule, sleep is crucial
6. **Comparing** - Don't compare Week 1 you to Year 2 developers

### ✅ DO:
1. **Celebrate small wins** - Finished a module? That's huge!
2. **Ask questions** - Use Reddit, Stack Overflow when stuck
3. **Take breaks** - Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break)
4. **Review daily** - 5 minutes reviewing yesterday's learning
5. **Stay consistent** - 25 hrs/week beats 40 hrs one week, 5 the next
6. **Build in public** - Share your journey, it creates accountability

---

## 💪 MOTIVATION & MINDSET

### Week 1 Mantra:
> "Every expert was once a beginner. Every professional had a first day. This is MY first week, and I'm showing up."

### Remember:
- You're not behind - you're exactly where you should be
- Confusion is part of learning - embrace it
- Mistakes are data points - they teach you
- Your bookkeeping background is an ASSET, not a liability
- You have a PLAN - most people don't

### When You Feel Overwhelmed:
1. Pause
2. Breathe
3. Review what you HAVE accomplished
4. Take a 10-minute walk
5. Return with fresh eyes
6. Just do the next small thing
