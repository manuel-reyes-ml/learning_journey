## 🚀 MOMENTUM BUILDERS

### Morning Routine Hack:
```
Lay out tomorrow morning's setup tonight:
□ Laptop plugged in, charging
□ Coffee maker prepped
□ Notebook & pen on desk
□ Today's learning plan printed/visible
□ Phone charging across the room (forces you up!)
□ Curtains open slightly (natural light helps)
```

### Evening Routine Hack:
```
Signal "study mode" to your brain:
□ Same workspace every time
□ Same opening ritual (water, stretch, deep breath)
□ Same music/playlist (Pavlov yourself!)
□ Same ending ritual (journal → commit → celebrate)
□ Phone away, notifications off
```
