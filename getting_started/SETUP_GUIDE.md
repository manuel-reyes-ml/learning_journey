## 🖥️ PART 1: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (Thursday Morning)
**Time:** 45 minutes

### 1.1 Python Installation

**What:** Python programming language
**Why:** Core language for data analysis
**When to do:** Thursday 5:00-5:15 AM

#### For Windows:

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to: [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
   - Click: "Download Python 3.11.7" (or latest 3.11.x)
   - File downloads: `python-3.11.7-amd64.exe`

2. **Install Python:**
   ```
   ✅ Run the downloaded .exe file
   ✅ ⚠️ CRITICAL: Check "Add Python to PATH" (bottom of installer)
   ✅ Click "Install Now"
   ✅ Wait for installation to complete (~2 min)
   ✅ Click "Close"
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Open Command Prompt (Windows key + R, type "cmd")
   python --version
   # Should show: Python 3.11.7

   pip --version
   # Should show: pip 23.x.x from [location]
   ```

4. **Install Essential Packages:**
   ```bash
   # In Command Prompt:
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

   # You should see:
   # "Successfully installed jupyter-X.X.X pandas-X.X.X ..."
   ```

#### For Mac:

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to: [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
   - Click: "Download Python 3.11.7"
   - File downloads: `python-3.11.7-macos11.pkg`

2. **Install Python:**
   ```
   ✅ Open the downloaded .pkg file
   ✅ Click "Continue" through installer
   ✅ Agree to license
   ✅ Click "Install"
   ✅ Enter password if prompted
   ✅ Installation takes ~3 min
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Open Terminal (Cmd + Space, type "Terminal")
   python3 --version
   # Should show: Python 3.11.7

   pip3 --version
   # Should show: pip 23.x.x
   ```

4. **Install Essential Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

**Troubleshooting:**
- "Python not recognized" → You didn't check "Add to PATH", reinstall
- "Permission denied" on Mac → Use `sudo pip3 install ...`
