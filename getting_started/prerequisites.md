## 📚 Prior Knowledge Required

### **Required: NONE! 🎉**

This journey starts from **absolute zero**:
- ❌ No programming experience needed
- ❌ No computer science degree required  
- ❌ No prior data analysis experience necessary
- ❌ No math beyond high school algebra (initially)

### **What Actually Helps:**
✅ **Basic computer literacy** - Can navigate folders, install apps, use web browser  
✅ **Comfortable with learning** - Reading docs, watching videos, googling errors  
✅ **Problem-solving mindset** - Willing to debug and figure things out  
✅ **English proficiency** - Most resources are in English

### **Nice to Have (But Not Required):**
- Excel/spreadsheet experience (helps with data intuition)
- Any domain expertise (finance, healthcare, marketing, etc.)
- Curiosity about how things work
- Experience with logic puzzles or structured thinking

**My Background:**
- 10+ years bookkeeping (finance domain expertise)
- 6+ years trading (quantitative thinking)
- Zero programming experience when I started
- High school math + self-taught trading analytics

**Key Point:** Domain expertise + new tech skills = unique value proposition

---

## ⏰ Time Commitment

### **Required Investment:**

**Minimum:**
- **20 hours/week** - Absolute minimum for meaningful progress
- **~3 hours/day** on weekdays + weekends

**Recommended (My Schedule):**
- **25 hours/week** - Sustainable for 37 months
- Mon-Fri: 3.5 hrs/day (early morning + evening)
- Saturday: 5.5 hrs (deep work on projects)
- Sunday: 2 hrs (review, planning, community)

**Reality Check:**
- This is a **marathon, not a sprint**
- Consistency > intensity
- Daily practice (even 20 min) beats weekend cramming
- Sustainable pace = long-term success

### **When to Study:**

**My Schedule (for reference):**
- 🌅 **4:30-6:00 AM** - Video lectures, reading (quiet focus time)
- 🏢 **During work** - 20 min Sololearn mobile practice (lunch break)
- 🌙 **8:00-10:00 PM** - Coding, projects, hands-on work
- 📅 **Saturday AM** - Deep work on complex projects
- 📅 **Sunday PM** - Weekly review, LinkedIn, planning

**Find what works for YOU:**
- Early bird? Study mornings before work
- Night owl? Study evenings after dinner
- Have lunch breaks? Do mobile practice
- Weekends free? Do longer deep work sessions

**Non-negotiable:** Must be consistent and sustainable for 37 months

## 🧠 Learning Prerequisites

### **Mindset Requirements:**

**Must Have:**
- ✅ **Growth mindset** - Believe skills can be learned
- ✅ **Patience** - Progress is incremental, not overnight
- ✅ **Resilience** - You WILL get stuck, frustrated, confused
- ✅ **Curiosity** - Genuinely want to understand, not just complete
- ✅ **Accountability** - Own your progress (or lack thereof)

**Good to Have:**
- 🎯 **Clear "why"** - Know why you're doing this (career change, money, passion)
- 💪 **Discipline** - Show up even when you don't feel like it
- 🤝 **Community** - Find others on similar journey (accountability)
- 📝 **Documentation habit** - Take notes, track progress

### **Common Misconceptions to Avoid:**

❌ **"I need to be a math genius"**  
✅ Reality: Basic algebra is enough for Stage 1. Advanced math comes gradually.

❌ **"I'm too old to learn programming"**  
✅ Reality: Career changers in 30s-50s succeed all the time. Age ≠ ability.

❌ **"I need to finish everything before applying to jobs"**  
✅ Reality: Apply when you have 3-5 solid projects (Month 4-5).

❌ **"I should learn everything before building projects"**  
✅ Reality: Build projects while learning. Projects solidify knowledge.

❌ **"Tutorial hell is learning"**  
✅ Reality: Doing > watching. Code every day, even if just 20 minutes.

### **Success Mindset:**

**Embrace:**
- 💡 **"I don't know, yet"** - Everything is learnable
- 🐛 **Errors are teachers** - Debug = learning
- 🔁 **Iteration over perfection** - Working code > pretty code
- 📊 **Progress over completion** - 1% better daily compounds
- 🌍 **Learning in public** - Share struggles and wins

**Avoid:**
- 🚫 Comparing to others (focus on YOUR progress)
- 🚫 Tutorial hell (watching without doing)
- 🚫 Perfectionism (done > perfect)
- 🚫 Waiting to feel "ready" (start before you're ready)
- 🚫 Going alone (find community/accountability)

## 💭 Final Thoughts

**The most important prerequisite is not on this list:**

It's **showing up consistently**, even when:
- You don't feel like it
- You're tired from work
- You don't understand something
- Progress feels slow
- Others seem further ahead

**Consistency beats intelligence.**  
**Persistence beats talent.**  
**Action beats planning.**

The person who studies 25 hours/week for 37 months beats the genius who studies sporadically.
